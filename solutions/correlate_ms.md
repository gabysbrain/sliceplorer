With this visualization technique the multi-dimensional space is mapped via a
non-linear mapping into the two axes used for visualization: `x1` and `x2`.
It is not really possible to back out what, if any, behavior due to the 
combination of `x1` and `x2` in the graph is due to the variation of one,
two, or multiple combinations of parameter values in the original function.
