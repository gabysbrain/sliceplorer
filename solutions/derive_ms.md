We can get a rough estimate of the variance of the function by looking at
the pattern of extrema in the visualization. Due to the non-linear warping
of the input space into two dimensions it is not possible to compute the
"area under the curve" for a particular function value. This is required to
visually derive measures such as the mean or sensitivity measures.
