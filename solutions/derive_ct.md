The graph layout algorithm tries to lay out the tree so that the y-position of
the nodes relates to the function value. The contour tree only shows extrema
and saddle points so these are the only points possible for which we can find
the function value. We can get an idea for the range of possible output values
of the function. However, since only the critical points are shown, any visual
estimates of mean, variance, etc will only take into account critical points.
