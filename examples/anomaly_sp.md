In the *crim* dimension we can see that some slices decrease with respect to
increasing *crim* value while others increase. This would imply that the
home price increases as the crime rate increases which is a bit of an anomaly.
In addition, for the *indus* dimension we can see that the two slices for
which the home price decreases rapidly between $0-4$.
