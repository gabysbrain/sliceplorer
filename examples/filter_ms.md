This is essentially a direct visualizaiton of the Morse-Smale complex.  We
could try to estimate the size of the parameter space above or below a certain
value by estimating the area covered by the graph.  The lines that connect the
critical points in the graph are estimations of the curvature of the function
under examination. Furthermore, the x-axes in the plot do not have any direct
coorespondence with the input parameter space.  It would be difficult to
estimate the area covered above a certain y-value let alone recover the input
values that correspond to this.
