This is very close to a direct visualization of the Morse-Smale complex of the
function. The Morse-Smale complex only shows the critical points of the
function: the maxima, minima, and saddle points. Here we can identify these
points. however there is no way to recover the input values corresponding to
these points. While there are 2 x-axes (labelled x1 and x2), these are a
non-linear warping of the input space into 2 dimensions for visualization
purposes and have no correspondence to the original input dimensions.  The
curve shown between the critical points is an estimation of the curvature of
the function in high dimensions but doesn't represent its true behavior.
