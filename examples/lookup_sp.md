In Sliceplorer the user can mouse over the x-axis of one of the plots and the
slice corresponding to the closest focus point to that location will be 
highlighted in red. The location of the focus point is also indicated on the
x-axis in the other plots. From this, the user can read off the fucntion value
from the slice. However, this can only be done for slices related to the 
sampled focus point.
