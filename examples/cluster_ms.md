We can see some patterns in the function behavior here. The Morse-Smale complex
extracts all critical points from the graph. This visaulization method uses a
non-linear mapping of the full (multi-D) input parameter space to
two-dimensions for visualization. These are the `x1` and `x2` axes. This
mapping tries to put points that are close in the parameter space will be close
in the visualization. Therefore, we will be able to see repeated patterns of
extrema in the manifold in this visualization.
