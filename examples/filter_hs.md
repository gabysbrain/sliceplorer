Given a particular focus point setting it is easy to find the parameter values
that give a function value greater than some value by reading them off the
heatmaps. The difficulty, however, comes with navigating the parameter space.
If we want to know *all* parameter settings than we must carefully browse 
through all possible focus points. This is relatively easy in 3 dimensions
since there is only one degree of freedom but in more it becomes very tedious
and difficult.
